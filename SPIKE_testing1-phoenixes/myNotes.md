Testing is not the easiest thing to do, but first lets understand.

Test Driven Development (TDD) :  a software development practice that focuses on creating unit test cases before developing the actual code. It is an iterative approach combining programming, unit test creation, and refactoring.

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development methodology that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code. The primary goal of TDD is to ensure that the codebase is reliable, maintainable, and correctly implements the desired functionality.

TDD follows a cyclic process, usually consisting of three main steps:

1- **Write a Test**: In this step, a developer writes a test case that defines the expected behavior of a specific piece of functionality. This test initially fails because the code to fulfill that functionality hasn't been implemented yet.

2- **Write the Code**: Once the test is in place, the developer writes the minimum amount of code required to make the test pass. The focus is on making the test case pass, rather than creating a complete solution at this stage.

3-**Refactor**: After the test case passes, the developer can refactor the code to improve its design, structure, and efficiency, while ensuring that all tests still pass. Refactoring helps maintain the code's quality and readability.

This cycle repeats for every new feature, bug fix, or enhancement that needs to be implemented. By continuously writing tests and then implementing code to satisfy those tests, TDD promotes a few key benefits:

 -**Better Code Quality**: TDD encourages developers to thoroughly think through requirements before writing code, resulting in more well-designed and well-structured solutions.

 -**Improved Test Coverage**: TDD ensures that most if not all of the codebase is covered by tests. This helps identify and fix issues early in the development process.

 -**Early Bug Detection**: Since tests are written before the code, any bugs or discrepancies are detected early in the development cycle, making them easier and less costly to fix.

 -**Clearer Specifications**: Writing tests acts as a form of documentation and serves as clear specifications for the desired behavior of the code.

 -**Confidence in Refactoring**: With a comprehensive test suite, developers can confidently refactor and modify code without fear of introducing new bugs or breaking existing functionality.

 -**Support for Collaboration**: TDD provides a common language between developers, testers, and stakeholders, as the tests act as a common reference for expected behavior.

While TDD can have a learning curve and might appear slower initially due to writing tests first, it can lead to faster development, reduced debugging time, and more maintainable code in the long run.

## we will use

Jest, which is one of the most standard libraries.

And as enviroment : extension Jest
